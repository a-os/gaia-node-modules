This must run before startSession.\nclient.plugin('logger', require('marionette-js-logger'));\n\nclient.startSession(function() {\n  logGrabber = client.logger;\n\n  // You can listen for the 'message' event, it will be fired when calls cause\n  // logs to be retrieved from the server.\n  logGrabber.on('message', function(msg) {\n    msg.window; // The URI of the document/window the log happened in\n    msg.level; // log/info/warn/error/exception/debug\n    msg.message; // raw string of message\n    msg.filename; // source file log call was made from\n    msg.lineNumber; // line number where call was made\n    msg.functionName; // function name where call was made\n    msg.timeStamp; // standard JS timestamp; milliseconds since the epoch (UTC) \n  };\n\n  // Explicitly fetch all available logs from the server, emitting 'message'\n  // events.\n  logGrabber.grabLogMessages();\n\n  // Fetch all available logs from the server, but if there aren't any there\n  // yet, wait for at least one new message to be logged.  This will wait for\n  // at least one turn of the event loop before returning for efficiency reasons\n  // and to avoid mistaken understandings of the state of the device.  Do not\n  // depend on this to leave certain messages on the device.\n  logGrabber.grabAtLeastOneNewMessage();\n\n  // Keep fetching logs from the server and calling the provided method until\n  // it returns true indicating it found the log message it wanted.  'message'\n  // events will still be emitted for all logs retrieved as a result of these\n  // calls.  While the function will only be called on messages until it returns\n  // true and will not be called for any messages retrieved after the first call\n  // that returns true, 'message' events will be emitted for ALL retrieved logs.\n  // Also, subsequent calls to waitForLogMessage will only call the function\n  // for newly retrieved logs.\n  logGrabber.waitForLogMessage(function checksEveryNewMessage(msg) {\n    return /my car keys/.test(msg.message);\n  });\n\n  client.executeScript(function() {\n    // this works too but more importantly all other console.log's in content work too\n    console.log(document.location.href);\n  });\n\n  client.deleteSession();\n});\n```\n\n### LICENSE\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Mozilla Foundation\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
