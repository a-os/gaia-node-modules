  "readme": "Messages: The official messaging application for Firefox OS\n============================================================\n\nThe Messages application lets users to send SMS (_short messages_) and MMS (_multimedia\nmessages_) using a phone running Firefox OS.\n\nHow to retrieve the code\n------------------------\nSMS is part of the Gaia Github repo. To download it you need `git` installed on\nyour computer, and you need to run the following command:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia\n```\n\nThe code for Gaia will be downloaded from Github to a local subdirectory `gaia`.\nYou can enter the `gaia` directory by typing:\n\n```bash\ncd gaia\n```\n\nHow to run the application in Firefox\n-------------------------------------\n\n* Install an up-to-date [Firefox Nightly](http://nightly.mozilla.org/) on your\n  computer. Bear in mind that Nightly can sometimes be broken; if you experience\n  problems try using [Firefox Aurora](https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/channel/#aurora)\n  instead (this may also not work as we rely on very recent functionality that is\n  sometimes only available in Nightly.)\n\n* Generate a Gaia debug profile and use the following commands to run it in\n  Nightly (this will take some time):\n\n```bash\nexport FIREFOX=/path/to/nightly/firefox\nPROFILE_FOLDER=profile-sms DEBUG=1 DESKTOP=0 make\n$FIREFOX -profile profile-sms --no-remote app://sms.gaiamobile.org\n```\n\n* Press _CTRL-SHIFT-M_ (or _Cmd-Opt-M_ on MacOS X) to switch the Responsive Mode.\n\n### Using the right fonts\n\n* You can download the [Fira Sans fonts](http://www.carrois.com/fira-3-1/#download)\n  and install them on your system.\n\n* Next, configure your Firefox to use them\n(_Preferences > Content > Fonts & Colors_ > change the default font. Also click\nthe _Advanced..._ button and update the _Proportional_, _Serif_ and _Sans-serif_\nfont preferences).\n\nIf you use Mulet (see below), this should already be done for you.\n\n### What works fine\n\nIn this mode, you can use the DevTools (_CTRL-SHIFT-K_, or _Cmd-Opt-K_ on MacOS\nX) to debug CSS and JavaScript. You can also install Firebug if you prefer it.\n\nIf you modify a file in the application directory, you can simply hit the\n_reload_ button to see the changes.\n\n### What doesn't work\n\n* The application uses some mockups for most APIs. That means they won't\n  remember anything from previous launches.\n* The application doesn't run inside Firefox OS. That means cross-application\n  communication (eg: activities) doesn't work. That also means it can't receive\n  SMS, although we fake this when you try to send a message.\n* We don't simulate Dual SIM in this mode.\n\n### What if the application doesn't load correctly?\n\nYou should try to delete your profile directory and regenerate it. If it still\ndoesn't work, please [file a bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox%20OS&component=Gaia%3A%3ASMS&short_desc=[Messages]%20Running%20the%20application%20in%20Firefox%20is%20broken)\nwith as much information as you can.\n\n### What if I want to simulate more things?\n\nEarly work has started on a Simulator that should make it possible to control\nthe API in a better way. Currently it works fine for Dual SIM\nsupport, which makes it easier to debug CSS or JavaScript in this mode.\n\nYou can cherry-pick the branch from [Bug 1069338](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1069338),\nand then load up _app://sms.gaiamobile.org/simulator/_.\n\nHow to run the application in Mulet\n-------------------\nMulet is a specialized browser build that allows us to run Gaia in an environment\ncloser to a real Firefox OS device, while still having access to Firefox's\ndeveloper tools. [You can find more information on\nMDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developing_Gaia/Different_ways_to_run_Gaia#Using_Gaia_in_Firefox_Mulet).\n\nHow to contribute to the development\n------------------------------------\n### Filing a good bug\n\nFiling a bug with the right information is already a very good first step\ntowards fixing a bug.\n\nHere are the important details to include:\n\n* Which device and Firefox OS version are you using? You'll get bonus points if\n  you can precisely state the Build Date, Gaia commit hash, and Gecko commit hash.\n* Describe precise steps you can follow to make the bug happen.\n* Does the bug happen every time? Otherwise, please include an estimate of how\n  often the bug happens (e.g. 5 times in 10.)\n* Provide a screenshot and even a video, if you can. To take a screenshot on a\n  Firefox OS device, you can use [WebIDE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE)\n  or longpress _Power+Volume Down_ (note: older\n  versions used _Power+Home_). [There's more than one way to do\n  it, see MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Debugging/taking_screenshots).\n\nOnce you have this information, you can [file the bug on\nBugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox%20OS&component=Gaia%3A%3ASMS)\nand we should handle it in a few days (most of the time before 1 day).\n\nYou can find [more information about filing bugs on\nMDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developing_Firefox_OS/Filing_bugs_against_Firefox_OS).\n\n### Finding a bug to fix\n\nWe maintain a list of non-urgent bugs that a contributor can take on. Usually we\ntry to add bugs in this list only if it can be fixed in Firefox using the\nprevious steps. We can have more involved bugs though, if you want more of a challenge. You can [consult the\nbug list here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?f1=bug_mentor&o1=isnotempty&resolution=---&emailtype1=exact&query_format=advanced&emailassigned_to1=1&email1=nobody%40mozilla.org&component=Gaia%3A%3ASMS&product=Firefox%20OS),\nand we also have a [list of easier bugs that new contributors can fix](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?o1=isnotempty&emailtype1=exact&status_whiteboard_type=substring&emailassigned_to1=1&status_whiteboard=[good%20first%20bug]&email1=nobody%40mozilla.org&f1=bug_mentor&resolution=---&query_format=advanced&component=Gaia%3A%3ASMS&product=Firefox%20OS).\n\nThe goal of these bugs is more about setting up the environment and getting used\nto the development process.\n\nYou can also [find bugs in other applications using Bugs Ahoy](http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/?b2g=1&unowned=1).\n\nOf course, you can also try to fix bugs that are not included in these lists, if\nyou find something more interesting.\n\nOnce you have found a bug you want to work on, please ask kindly on the bug if\nyou can work on the issue. The owner/mentor should respond soon enough.\n\n### Fixing the bug and proposing a patch\n\n[A lot of useful information can be found on MDN already](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developing_Gaia)\nso we won't repeat it here. Be careful as MDN explains how to run the full Gaia\napp suite in Firefox, whereas here we are interested in working on the Messages\napp specifically.\n\nYou can also find some information about the Messages app development process\n[on the Wiki page for the Messages app](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gaia/SMS),\nincluding links to the always evolving code style guidelines.\n\nIf you want more help you can discuss the Messages app on [IRC](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC):\nsee the _#gaia_\nand _#gaia-messaging_ channels on the _irc.mozilla.org_ IRC server.\n\n### Running unit tests\n\nYou can find [very detailed instructions on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Platform/Automated_testing/Gaia_unit_tests)\nconcerning running Gaia's unit tests. Please refer to those instructions if you have issues.\n\nHere are some basic instructions, assuming your Firefox Nightly is installed in\n`~/firefox-nightly/`. Please adjust the instructions to your own environment.\n\nThese lines will run what we call the test server: both Firefox and the\nbackground server, that are needed to run the tests:\n\n```bash\nexport FIREFOX=~/firefox-nightly/firefox\nbin/gaia-test\n```\n\nThe background server runs a watcher that automatically runs tests when the\nfiles are saved. To run a specific file you can simply open it in an editor\nand save it, or use the command line tool `touch`.\n\nIf you want to run all tests for the SMS app, you can run the following in a separate\nterminal:\n\n```bash\nAPP=sms make test-agent-test\n```\n\n## JSDOC\n\nGenerated jsdoc is hosted on [http://mozilla-b2g.github.io/gaia/sms/](http://mozilla-b2g.github.io/gaia/sms/). You can generate it locally with the following command:\n\n```\n$ gulp jsdoc:sms\n```\n",
